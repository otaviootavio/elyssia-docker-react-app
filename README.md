# Pizza Order Organizer App
## Introduction

This application is an experimental project built using cutting-edge technologies. It's designed to organize pizza orders, focusing on a feature that counts pizza slices. The project serves as a playground for exploring new frameworks and libraries in web development.
Technology Stack
- Frontend: Developed with Vite, a modern frontend build tool, providing a fast and lean development experience.
- Backend: Utilizes Elysia.js and Bun. Elysia.js is a new JavaScript framework that brings an innovative approach to building efficient and scalable server-side applications. Bun is a fresh take on JavaScript runtime, offering unique features and optimizations.

Important Notes:
- Elysia.js: As of now, Elysia.js has not reached its version 1.0. This means the framework is still in its experimental phase and may undergo significant changes.
- Bun: While promising, Bun currently has several unresolved issues that might affect the stability and reliability of applications.

Due to these factors, this application is not recommended for deployment in a production environment.

Features
- Pizza Slice Counter: The primary feature of this app is to count and organize pizza slices for orders. This feature is in a working state but may require further development for additional functionalities.

Project Status

This project is currently in a halted state. The primary functionality - the pizza slice counter - is implemented, but further development is required for a complete suite of features.
